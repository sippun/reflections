What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a /.git folder is created in your directory. 
The repository has no inital commit. A repository needs to be initialized 
because then you can start using version control in your directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and repository in that
files in the staging area are on a temporary hold to be added to the repository.
Since changes are put into the staging area and not committed immediately, an
accidental commit is less likely to happen. It also lets you control more finely
what to commit.
